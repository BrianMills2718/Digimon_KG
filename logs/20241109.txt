And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Text: .

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and
having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening
with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had
once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of
rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run
there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other
houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and
dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,
who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed
as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact
that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy
about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a
bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne
in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his
last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,
having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but
Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects
in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as
Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly
forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.
That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to
be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would
be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned
it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;
and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to
be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the
hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws
and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed
it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,
and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a
separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the
balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen
gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so
you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and
Scrooge liked it. But,

Text: residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an
excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started
from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died
before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for
instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years
afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was
known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called
Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It
was all the same to him.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his
own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the
dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could
warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than
he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain
less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The
heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the
advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My
dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was
o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to
such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'

But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his
way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep
its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas
Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,
biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court
outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,
and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City
clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had
not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the
neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The
fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,
obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,
and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he

  "How now?" said Scrooge, caustic
    and cold as ever. "What do you
    want with me?"                                           _Frontispiece_

  Bob Cratchit went down a slide on
    Cornhill, at the end of a lane of
    boys, twenty times, in honour of
    its being Christmas Eve                                           16

  Nobody under the bed; nobody in
    the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,
    which was hanging up
    in a suspicious attitude against
    the wall                                                          20

  The air was filled with phantoms,
   wandering hither and thither in
    restless haste and moaning as
    they went                                                         32

  Then old Fezziwig stood out to
    dance with Mrs. Fezziwig                                          54

  A flushed and boisterous group                                      62

  Laden with Christmas toys and
    presents                                                          64

  The way he went after that plump
    sister in the lace tucker!                                       100

  "How are you?" said one.
    "How are you?" returned the other.
   "Well!" said the first. "Old
    Scratch has got his own at last,
    hey?"                                                            114

  "What do you call this?" said Joe.
    "Bed-curtains!" "Ah!" returned
    the woman, laughing....
    "Bed-curtains!"

  "You don't mean to say you took
    'em down, rings and all, with him
    lying there?" said Joe.

  "Yes, I do," replied the woman.
    "Why not?"                                                       120

  "It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have
    come to dinner. Will you let
    me in, Fred?"                                                    144

  "Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,"
    said Scrooge. "I am not going
    to stand this sort of thing any
    longer."                                                         146

MARLEY'S GHOST


Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
residuary legatee,

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

They were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.

Tension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity's place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.

Their connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer's latter instincts gained precedence— the team's mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare. A metamorphosis had begun, and Operation: Dulce hummed with the newfound frequency of their daring, a tone set not by the earthly

their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

Text: business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.
Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion
of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with
flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in
carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a
Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its
teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became
intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers
were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned
to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and
berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:
a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord
Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household
should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on
the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,
stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and
the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good
St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such
weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he
would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,
gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;
but, at the first sound of

  'God bless you, merry gentleman,
  May nothing you dismay!'

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled
in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial
frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an
ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the
fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his
candle out, and put on his hat.

'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.

'If quite convenient, sir.'

'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to
stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'

The clerk smiled faintly.

'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a
day's wages for no work.'

[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end
of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas
Eve_]

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

Text: might keep his
eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.

'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
was the first intimation he had of his approach.

'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
that, I am sure?'

'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'

Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'

'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.

'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.'

'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'

'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
Much good it has ever done you!'

'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately
sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the
last frail spark for ever.

'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful
speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the
whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that
extremity first.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get

Text: , before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.

[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall_]

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
old Marley's head on every one.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.

'Because I fell in love.'

'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good
afternoon!'

'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give
it as a reason for not coming now?'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never
had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'And A Happy New Year!'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my
clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking
about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people
in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with
their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their
hands, and bowed to him.

'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring
to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died
seven years ago, this very night.'

'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving
partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
credentials back.

'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.

'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
operation?'

'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
not.'

'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.

'Both very busy, sir.'

'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
glad to hear it.'

'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
put you down for?'

'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.

'You wish to be anonymous?'

'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
badly off must go there.'

'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'

'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'

'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.

'It's not my

And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

Text: business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.
Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion
of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with
flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in
carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a
Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its
teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became
intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers
were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned
to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and
berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:
a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord
Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household
should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on
the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,
stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and
the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good
St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such
weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he
would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,
gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;
but, at the first sound of

  'God bless you, merry gentleman,
  May nothing you dismay!'

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled
in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial
frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an
ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the
fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his
candle out, and put on his hat.

'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.

'If quite convenient, sir.'

'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to
stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'

The clerk smiled faintly.

'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a
day's wages for no work.'

[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end
of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas
Eve_]

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

Text: .

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and
having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening
with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had
once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of
rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run
there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other
houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and
dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,
who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed
as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact
that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy
about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a
bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne
in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his
last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,
having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but
Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects
in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as
Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly
forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.
That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to
be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would
be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned
it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;
and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to
be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the
hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws
and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed
it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,
and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a
separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the
balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen
gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so
you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and
Scrooge liked it. But,

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

Text: might keep his
eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.

'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
was the first intimation he had of his approach.

'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
that, I am sure?'

'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'

Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'

'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.

'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.'

'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'

'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
Much good it has ever done you!'

'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately
sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the
last frail spark for ever.

'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful
speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the
whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that
extremity first.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get

  "How now?" said Scrooge, caustic
    and cold as ever. "What do you
    want with me?"                                           _Frontispiece_

  Bob Cratchit went down a slide on
    Cornhill, at the end of a lane of
    boys, twenty times, in honour of

  "How are you?" said one.
    "How are you?" returned the other.
   "Well!" said the first. "Old

    "Bed-curtains!" "Ah!" returned
    the woman, laughing....
    "Bed-curtains!"

  "You don't mean to say you took
    'em down, rings and all, with him
    lying there?" said Joe.

  "Yes, I do," replied the woman.
    "Why not?"                                                       120

MARLEY'S GHOST


Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
residuary legatee,

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

Entity_types: organization,person,geo,event
Text: residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an
excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started
from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died
before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for
instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years
afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was
known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called
Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It
was all the same to him.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his
own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the
dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could
warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than
he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain
less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The
heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the
advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My
dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was
o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to
such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'

But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his
way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep
its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas
Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,
biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court
outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,
and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City
clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had
not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the
neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The
fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,
obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,
and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he

Text: , before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.

[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall_]

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
old Marley's head on every one.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.

'Because I fell in love.'

'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good
afternoon!'

'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give
it as a reason for not coming now?'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never
had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'And A Happy New Year!'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my
clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking
about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people
in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with
their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their
hands, and bowed to him.

'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring
to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died
seven years ago, this very night.'

'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving
partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
credentials back.

'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.

'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
operation?'

'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
not.'

'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.

'Both very busy, sir.'

'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
glad to hear it.'

'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
put you down for?'

'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.

'You wish to be anonymous?'

'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
badly off must go there.'

'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'

'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'

'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.

'It's not my

And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Text: business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.
Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion
of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with
flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in
carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a
Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its
teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became
intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers
were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned
to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and
berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:
a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord
Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household
should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on
the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,
stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and
the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good
St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such
weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he
would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,
gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;
but, at the first sound of

  'God bless you, merry gentleman,
  May nothing you dismay!'

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled
in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial
frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an
ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the
fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his
candle out, and put on his hat.

'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.

'If quite convenient, sir.'

'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to
stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'

The clerk smiled faintly.

'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a
day's wages for no work.'

[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end
of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas
Eve_]

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

    and cold as ever. "What do you

  Bob Cratchit went down a slide on
    Cornhill, at the end of a lane of
    boys, twenty times, in honour of
    its being Christmas Eve                                           16

  Nobody under the bed; nobody in
    the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,
    which was hanging up
    in a suspicious attitude against

   wandering hither and thither in
    restless haste and moaning as
    they went                                                         32

  Then old Fezziwig stood out to

  A flushed and boisterous group                                      62

  The way he went after that plump
    sister in the lace tucker!                                       100

  "How are you?" said one.
    "How are you?" returned the other.
   "Well!" said the first. "Old
    Scratch has got his own at last,
    hey?"                                                            114

  "What do you call this?" said Joe.
    "Bed-curtains!" "Ah!" returned
    the woman, laughing....
    "Bed-curtains!"

  "You don't mean to say you took
    'em down, rings and all, with him
    lying there?" said Joe.

  "Yes, I do," replied the woman.
    "Why not?"                                                       120

  "It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have
    come to dinner. Will you let
    me in, Fred?"                                                    144

  "Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,"
    said Scrooge. "I am not going
    to stand this sort of thing any
    longer."                                                         146

MARLEY'S GHOST


Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the

unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
residuary legatee,

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.

'Because I fell in love.'

'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good
afternoon!'

'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give
it as a reason for not coming now?'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never
had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'And A Happy New Year!'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my
clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking
about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people
in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with
their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their
hands, and bowed to him.

'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring
to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died
seven years ago, this very night.'

'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving
partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
credentials back.

'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.

'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
operation?'

'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
not.'

'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.

'Both very busy, sir.'

'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
glad to hear it.'

'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
put you down for?'

'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.

'You wish to be anonymous?'

'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
badly off must go there.'

'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'

'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'

'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.

'It's not my

Text: might keep his
eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.

'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
was the first intimation he had of his approach.

'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
that, I am sure?'

'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'

Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'

'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.

'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.'

'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'

'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
Much good it has ever done you!'

'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately
sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the
last frail spark for ever.

'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful
speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the

Text: .

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and
having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening
with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had
once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of
rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run
there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other
houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and
dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,
who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed
as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact
that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy
about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a
bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne
in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his
last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,
having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but
Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects
in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as
Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly
forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.
That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to
be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would
be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned
it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;
and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to
be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the
hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws
and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed
it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,
and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a
separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the
balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen
gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so
you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and
Scrooge liked it. But,

Entity_types: organization,person,geo,event
Text: residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an
excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started
from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died
before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for
instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years
afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was
known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called
Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It
was all the same to him.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his
own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the
dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could
warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than
he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain
less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The
heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the
advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My
dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was
o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to
such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'

But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his
way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep
its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas
Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,
biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court
outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,
and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City
clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had
not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the
neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The
fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,
obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,
and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he

Text: , before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.

[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall_]

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
old Marley's head on every one.

And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys.

Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still in\noperation?\'\n\n\'They are. Still,\' returned the gentleman, \'I wish I could say they were\nnot.\'\n\n\'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Both very busy, sir.\'\n\n\'Oh!

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

    longer."                                                         146

MARLEY'S GHOST


Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
residuary legatee,

Entity_types: organization,person,geo,event
Text: .

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and
having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening
with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had
once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of
rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run
there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other
houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and
dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,
who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed
as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact
that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy
about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a
bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne
in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his
last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,
having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but
Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects
in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as
Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly
forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.
That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to
be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would
be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned
it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;
and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to
be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the
hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws
and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed
it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,
and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a
separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the
balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen
gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so
you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and
Scrooge liked it. But,

Text: might keep his
eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.

'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
was the first intimation he had of his approach.

'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
that, I am sure?'

'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'

Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'

'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.

'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.'

'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'

'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
Much good it has ever done you!'

'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately
sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the
last frail spark for ever.

'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful
speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the
whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that
extremity first.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.

'Because I fell in love.'

'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good
afternoon!'

'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give
it as a reason for not coming now?'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never
had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'And A Happy New Year!'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my
clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking
about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people
in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with
their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their
hands, and bowed to him.

'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring
to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died
seven years ago, this very night.'

'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving
partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
credentials back.

'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.

'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
operation?'

'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
not.'

'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.

'Both very busy, sir.'

'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
glad to hear it.'

'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
put you down for?'

'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.

'You wish to be anonymous?'

'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
badly off must go there.'

'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'

'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'

'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.

'It's not my

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

The encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation

Text: , before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.

[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall_]

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
old Marley's head on every one.

And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

Text: business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.
Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion
of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with
flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in
carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a
Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its
teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became
intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers
were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned
to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and
berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:
a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord
Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household
should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on
the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,
stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and
the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good
St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such
weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he
would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,
gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;
but, at the first sound of

  'God bless you, merry gentleman,
  May nothing you dismay!'

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled
in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial
frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an
ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the
fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his
candle out, and put on his hat.

'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.

'If quite convenient, sir.'

'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to
stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'

The clerk smiled faintly.

'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a
day's wages for no work.'

[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end
of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas
Eve_]

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

  "How now?" said Scrooge, caustic
    and cold as ever. "What do you
    want with me?"                                           _Frontispiece_

  Bob Cratchit went down a slide on
    Cornhill, at the end of a lane of
    boys, twenty times, in honour of
    its being Christmas Eve                                           16

  Nobody under the bed; nobody in
    the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,
    which was hanging up
    in a suspicious attitude against
    the wall                                                          20

  The air was filled with phantoms,
   wandering hither and thither in
    restless haste and moaning as
    they went                                                         32

  Then old Fezziwig stood out to
    dance with Mrs. Fezziwig                                          54

  A flushed and boisterous group                                      62

  Laden with Christmas toys and
    presents                                                          64

  The way he went after that plump
    sister in the lace tucker!                                       100

  "How are you?" said one.
    "How are you?" returned the other.
   "Well!" said the first. "Old
    Scratch has got his own at last,
    hey?"                                                            114

  "What do you call this?" said Joe.
    "Bed-curtains!" "Ah!" returned
    the woman, laughing....
    "Bed-curtains!"

  "You don't mean to say you took
    'em down, rings and all, with him
    lying there?" said Joe.

  "Yes, I do," replied the woman.
    "Why not?"                                                       120

  "It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have
    come to dinner. Will you let
    me in, Fred?"                                                    144

  "Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,"
    said Scrooge. "I am not going
    to stand this sort of thing any
    longer."                                                         146

MARLEY'S GHOST


Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
residuary legatee,

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

Text: might keep his
eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.

'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
was the first intimation he had of his approach.

'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
that, I am sure?'

'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'

Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'

'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.

'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.'

'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'

'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
Much good it has ever done you!'

'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately
sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the
last frail spark for ever.

'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful
speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the
whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that
extremity first.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get

Text: residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an
excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started
from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died
before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for
instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years
afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was
known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called
Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It
was all the same to him.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his
own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the
dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could
warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than
he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain
less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The
heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the
advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My
dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was
o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to
such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'

But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his
way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep
its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas
Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,
biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court
outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,
and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City
clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had
not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the
neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The
fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,
obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,
and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he

Text: , before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.

[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall_]

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
old Marley's head on every one.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.

'Because I fell in love.'

'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good
afternoon!'

'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give
it as a reason for not coming now?'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never
had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'And A Happy New Year!'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my
clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking
about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people
in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with
their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their
hands, and bowed to him.

'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring
to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died
seven years ago, this very night.'

'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving
partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
credentials back.

'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.

'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
operation?'

'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
not.'

'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.

'Both very busy, sir.'

'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
glad to hear it.'

'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
put you down for?'

'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.

'You wish to be anonymous?'

'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
badly off must go there.'

'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'

'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'

'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.

'It's not my

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and
having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening
with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had
once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of
rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run
there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other
houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and
dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,
who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed
as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact
that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy
about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a
bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne
in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his
last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,
having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but
Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects
in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as
Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly
forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.
That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to
be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would
be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned
it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;
and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to
be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the
hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws
and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed
it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,
and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a
separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the
balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen
gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so
you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and
Scrooge liked it. But,

And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

Text: .

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and
having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening
with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had
once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of
rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run
there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other
houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and
dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,
who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed
as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact
that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy
about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a
bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne
in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his
last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,
having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but
Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects
in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as
Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly
forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.
That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to
be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would
be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned
it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;
and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to
be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the
hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws
and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed
it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,
and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a
separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the
balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen
gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so
you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and
Scrooge liked it. But,

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

  "How now?" said Scrooge, caustic
    and cold as ever. "What do you
    want with me?"                                           _Frontispiece_

  Bob Cratchit went down a slide on
    Cornhill, at the end of a lane of
    boys, twenty times, in honour of
    its being Christmas Eve                                           16

  Nobody under the bed; nobody in

   wandering hither and thither in
    restless haste and moaning as
    they went                                                         32

    sister in the lace tucker!                                       100

  "How are you?" said one.
    "How are you?" returned the other.
   "Well!" said the first. "Old
    Scratch has got his own at last,
    hey?"                                                            114

  "What do you call this?" said Joe.
    "Bed-curtains!" "Ah!" returned
    the woman, laughing....
    "Bed-curtains!"

  "You don't mean to say you took
    'em down, rings and all, with him
    lying there?" said Joe.

  "Yes, I do," replied the woman.
    "Why not?"                                                       120

  "It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have
    come to dinner. Will you let
    me in, Fred?"                                                    144

  "Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,"
    said Scrooge. "I am not going
    to stand this sort of thing any
    longer."                                                         146

MARLEY'S GHOST


Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
residuary legatee,

Text: residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an
excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started
from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died
before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for
instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years
afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was
known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called
Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It
was all the same to him.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his
own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the
dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could
warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than
he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain
less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The
heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the
advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My
dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was
o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to
such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'

But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his
way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep
its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas
Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,
biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court
outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,
and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City
clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had
not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the
neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The
fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,
obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,
and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he

Text: business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.
Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion
of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with
flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in
carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a
Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its
teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became
intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers
were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned
to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and
berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:
a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord
Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household
should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on
the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,
stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and
the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good
St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such
weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he
would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,
gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;
but, at the first sound of

  'God bless you, merry gentleman,
  May nothing you dismay!'

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled
in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial
frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an
ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the
fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his
candle out, and put on his hat.

'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.

'If quite convenient, sir.'

'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to
stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'

The clerk smiled faintly.

'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a
day's wages for no work.'

[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end
of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas
Eve_]

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

Text: , before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.

[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall_]

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
old Marley's head on every one.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.

'Because I fell in love.'

'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good
afternoon!'

'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give
it as a reason for not coming now?'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never
had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'And A Happy New Year!'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my
clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking
about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people
in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with
their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their
hands, and bowed to him.

'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring
to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died
seven years ago, this very night.'

'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving
partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
credentials back.

'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.

'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
operation?'

'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
not.'

'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.

'Both very busy, sir.'

'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
glad to hear it.'

'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
put you down for?'

'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.

'You wish to be anonymous?'

'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
badly off must go there.'

'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'

'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'

'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.

'It's not my

eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.

'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
was the first intimation he had of his approach.

'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
that, I am sure?'

'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'

Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'

'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.

'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.'

'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'

'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
Much good it has ever done you!'

'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately
sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the
last frail spark for ever.

'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful
speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the
whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that
extremity first.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get

And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

  "How now?" said Scrooge, caustic
    and cold as ever. "What do you
    want with me?"                                           _Frontispiece_

  Bob Cratchit went down a slide on
    Cornhill, at the end of a lane of
    boys, twenty times, in honour of
    its being Christmas Eve                                           16

  Nobody under the bed; nobody in
    the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,
    which was hanging up
    in a suspicious attitude against
    the wall                                                          20

  The air was filled with phantoms,
   wandering hither and thither in
    restless haste and moaning as
    they went                                                         32

  Then old Fezziwig stood out to
    dance with Mrs. Fezziwig                                          54

  A flushed and boisterous group                                      62

  Laden with Christmas toys and
    presents                                                          64

  The way he went after that plump
    sister in the lace tucker!                                       100

  "How are you?" said one.
    "How are you?" returned the other.
   "Well!" said the first. "Old
    Scratch has got his own at last,
    hey?"                                                            114

  "What do you call this?" said Joe.
    "Bed-curtains!" "Ah!" returned
    the woman, laughing....
    "Bed-curtains!"

  "You don't mean to say you took
    'em down, rings and all, with him
    lying there?" said Joe.

  "Yes, I do," replied the woman.
    "Why not?"                                                       120

  "It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have
    come to dinner. Will you let
    me in, Fred?"                                                    144

  "Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,"
    said Scrooge. "I am not going
    to stand this sort of thing any
    longer."                                                         146

MARLEY'S GHOST


Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
residuary legatee,

Text: business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.
Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion
of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with
flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in
carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a
Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its
teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became
intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers
were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned
to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and
berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:
a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord
Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household
should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on
the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,
stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and
the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good
St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such
weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he
would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,
gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;
but, at the first sound of

  'God bless you, merry gentleman,
  May nothing you dismay!'

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled
in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial
frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an
ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the
fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his
candle out, and put on his hat.

'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.

'If quite convenient, sir.'

'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to
stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'

The clerk smiled faintly.

'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a
day's wages for no work.'

[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end
of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas
Eve_]

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

Text: .

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and
having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening
with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had
once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of
rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run
there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other
houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and
dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,
who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed
as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact
that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy
about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a
bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne
in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his
last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,
having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but
Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects
in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as
Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly
forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.
That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to
be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would
be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned
it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;
and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to
be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the
hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws
and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed
it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,
and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a
separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the
balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen
gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so
you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and
Scrooge liked it. But,

Text: might keep his
eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.

'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
was the first intimation he had of his approach.

'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
that, I am sure?'

'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'

Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'

'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.

'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.'

'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'

'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
Much good it has ever done you!'

'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately
sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the
last frail spark for ever.

'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful
speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the
whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that
extremity first.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get

Text: residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an
excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started
from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died
before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for
instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years
afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was
known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called
Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It
was all the same to him.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his
own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the
dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could
warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than
he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain
less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The
heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the
advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My
dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was
o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to
such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'

But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his
way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep
its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas
Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,
biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court
outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,
and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City
clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had
not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the
neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The
fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,
obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,
and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never
had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'And A Happy New Year!'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my
clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking
about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people
in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with
their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their
hands, and bowed to him.

'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring
to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died
seven years ago, this very night.'

'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving
partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
credentials back.

'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.

'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
operation?'

'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
not.'

'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.

'Both very busy, sir.'

'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
glad to hear it.'

'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
put you down for?'

'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.

'You wish to be anonymous?'

'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
badly off must go there.'

'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'

'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'

'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.

'It's not my

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

Text: , before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.

[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall_]

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
old Marley's head on every one.

And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Text: might keep his
eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.

'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
was the first intimation he had of his approach.

'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
that, I am sure?'

'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'

Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'

'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.

'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.'

'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'

'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
Much good it has ever done you!'

'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately
sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the
last frail spark for ever.

'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful
speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the
whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that
extremity first.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get

Text: business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.
Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion
of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with
flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in
carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a
Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its
teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became
intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers
were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned
to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and
berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:
a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord
Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household
should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on
the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,
stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and
the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good
St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such
weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he
would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,
gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;
but, at the first sound of

  'God bless you, merry gentleman,
  May nothing you dismay!'

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled
in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial
frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an
ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the
fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his
candle out, and put on his hat.

'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.

'If quite convenient, sir.'

'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to
stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'

The clerk smiled faintly.

'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a
day's wages for no work.'

[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end
of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas
Eve_]

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

Text: .

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and
having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening
with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had
once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of
rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run
there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other
houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and
dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,
who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed
as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact
that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy
about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a
bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne
in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his
last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,
having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but
Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects
in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as
Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly
forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.
That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to
be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would
be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned
it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;
and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to
be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the
hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws
and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed
it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,
and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a
separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the
balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen
gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so
you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and
Scrooge liked it. But,

Text: residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an
excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started
from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died
before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for
instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years
afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was
known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called
Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It
was all the same to him.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his
own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the
dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could
warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than
he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain
less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The
heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the
advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My
dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was
o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to
such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'

But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his
way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep
its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas
Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,
biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court
outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,
and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City
clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had
not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the
neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The
fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,
obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,
and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he

  "How now?" said Scrooge, caustic
    and cold as ever. "What do you
    want with me?"                                           _Frontispiece_

  Bob Cratchit went down a slide on
    Cornhill, at the end of a lane of
    boys, twenty times, in honour of
    its being Christmas Eve                                           16

  Nobody under the bed; nobody in
    the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,
    which was hanging up
    in a suspicious attitude against
    the wall                                                          20

  The air was filled with phantoms,
   wandering hither and thither in
    restless haste and moaning as
    they went                                                         32

  Then old Fezziwig stood out to
    dance with Mrs. Fezziwig                                          54

  A flushed and boisterous group                                      62

  Laden with Christmas toys and
    presents                                                          64

  The way he went after that plump
    sister in the lace tucker!                                       100

  "How are you?" said one.
    "How are you?" returned the other.
   "Well!" said the first. "Old
    Scratch has got his own at last,
    hey?"                                                            114

  "What do you call this?" said Joe.
    "Bed-curtains!" "Ah!" returned
    the woman, laughing....
    "Bed-curtains!"

  "You don't mean to say you took
    'em down, rings and all, with him
    lying there?" said Joe.

  "Yes, I do," replied the woman.
    "Why not?"                                                       120

  "It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have
    come to dinner. Will you let
    me in, Fred?"                                                    144

  "Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,"
    said Scrooge. "I am not going
    to stand this sort of thing any
    longer."                                                         146

MARLEY'S GHOST


Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
residuary legatee,

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

The encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.

'Because I fell in love.'

'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good
afternoon!'

'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give
it as a reason for not coming now?'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never
had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'And A Happy New Year!'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my
clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking
about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people
in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with
their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their
hands, and bowed to him.

'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring
to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died
seven years ago, this very night.'

'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving
partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
credentials back.

'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.

'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
operation?'

'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
not.'

'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.

'Both very busy, sir.'

'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
glad to hear it.'

'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
put you down for?'

'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.

'You wish to be anonymous?'

'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
badly off must go there.'

'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'

'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'

'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.

'It's not my

their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

Text: , before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.

[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall_]

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
old Marley's head on every one.

And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nSc\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

Entity_types: organization,person,geo,event
Text: residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an
excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started
from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died
before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for
instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years
afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was
known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called
Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It
was all the same to him.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his
own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the
dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could
warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than
he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain
less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The
heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the
advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My
dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was
o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to
such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'

But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his
way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep
its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas
Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,
biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court
outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,
and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City
clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had
not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the
neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The
fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,
obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,
and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he

Text: business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.
Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion
of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with
flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in
carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a
Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its
teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became
intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers
were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned
to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and
berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:
a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord
Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household
should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on
the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,
stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and
the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good
St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such
weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he
would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,
gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;
but, at the first sound of

  'God bless you, merry gentleman,
  May nothing you dismay!'

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled
in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial
frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an
ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the
fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his
candle out, and put on his hat.

'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.

'If quite convenient, sir.'

'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to
stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'

The clerk smiled faintly.

'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a
day's wages for no work.'

[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end
of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas
Eve_]

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

Text: might keep his
eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.

'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
was the first intimation he had of his approach.

'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
that, I am sure?'

'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'

Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'

'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.

'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.'

'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'

'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
Much good it has ever done you!'

'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately
sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the
last frail spark for ever.

'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful
speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the
whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that
extremity first.

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get

Text: .

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and
having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening
with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had
once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of
rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run
there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other
houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and
dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,
who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed
as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact
that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy
about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a
bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne
in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his
last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,
having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but
Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects
in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as
Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly
forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.
That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to
be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would
be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned
it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;
and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to
be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the
hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws
and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed
it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,
and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a
separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the
balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and

  Nobody under the bed; nobody in

  The air was filled with phantoms,
   wandering hither and thither in
    restless haste and moaning as
    they went                                                         32

  Then old Fezziwig stood out to
    dance with Mrs. Fezziwig                                          54

  A flushed and boisterous group                                      62

  Laden with Christmas toys and

MARLEY'S GHOST


Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
residuary legatee,

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'

'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.

'Because I fell in love.'

'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good
afternoon!'

'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give
it as a reason for not coming now?'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never
had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'

'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.

'And A Happy New Year!'

'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my
clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking
about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people
in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with
their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their
hands, and bowed to him.

'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring
to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died
seven years ago, this very night.'

'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving
partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
credentials back.

'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.

'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
operation?'

'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
not.'

'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.

'Both very busy, sir.'

'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
glad to hear it.'

'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
put you down for?'

'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.

'You wish to be anonymous?'

'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
badly off must go there.'

'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'

'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'

'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.

'It's not my

their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

The encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation

Text: , before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.

[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall_]

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
old Marley's head on every one.
